# An alternative to classical American healthcare

## Introduction

For context, John Oliver recent did a piece on Health Care Share Ministries (HCSM).

While he pointed out to a number of different issues such as no healthcare on religious grounds, or the possibility of some being a scam.

He was also clear about a number of factors:

1. They are legally free to largely do what they want
2. There is no tax penalty for an individual choosing a HCSM over a traditional health insurance plan.

## Proposal

We have all seen the likes of Bernie, John, Obama anyone you can think of talk about all these issues.  Of which some things have gotten better, while some things have remained relatively static.  One of which is healthcare.

After immediately watching the episode I realised, given that John's legal team had set one of these up, that it could be a world changing loophole.


## Advantages of a HCSM

#### No Red tape - kill buearocratic advantage

One of the reasons certain companies refuse to fail is because there are few competitors.  Why are there so few competitors? Sometimes it is due to the fact that red tape actually protects them from incumbents.  What do I mean by this? If you were to attempt to create a health insurance company in Amercia you would need a lot of money to start the company just to ensure all the rules are followed.  So before you start building the insurance company you already need X million.

Knowing (or at least it appears) that these companies have nearly 0 regulation the system is at an advantage (to both those who may want to do harm but also those who want to do good).

#### Simpler

While in this case simple is a relative term.  It seems the process works as follows:

1. You pay cash in
2. You send your hospital bill to the HCSM and they pay the bill.

Now you may be asking, well insurance companies are pretty complicated.  They do try and give you the lowest price for the insurance using a ton of maths.

Yes that is true.  But at the same time they are also TRYING to make as much money as possible.  It is partly why the maths is more complicated, in order to make a profit. In other words some reasonable actuaries (insurance nerds) could solve this problem sufficiently if extreme greed was removed from the equation.

If you are not beholden to certain levels of growth over arbitrary time scales.  If you do NOT plan on paying your CEO 30million a year, or have 5 levels of executive staff all compensated at 2million+. Are not on the stock exchange (so constantly having to think short term or ROI).  You can simply focus on a good project.

## Issues when setting one up

#### Initial stock of money

Understandably everyone should have the health care they need and everyone should be honest about their healthcare needs.  If the company was started and everyone claimed the company would be bust in 10seconds.  Yes it would.  You could put 10 billion in there and without the proper system it would all be claimed immediately.

How to combat this:
1. Start with <25 age. Maybe even certain cities/areas in the US. This may seem brutal.  They may not need it as much.  Though, even as they pay less for their insurance, they will start to add to the initial pile (like crowdfunding but instead of a hat you get to see a psychiatrist).  As the pool increases, the actuaries can get more mathsy and start to increase the age limit.
2. Fraud/exorbitant from a hospital.  This would be hit up on algorithms.  Once enough procedures/pills/whatever and their prices had been collected (ideally pre-launch) you can monitor excessive fees.  Then use the pot of fees already collected to start lowering health prices.
3. Individual fraud.  Again this would be reasonably easy with a bit of algo magic.  If certain internet companies know you are pregnant before you are I'm sure across a system of requests you could flag and investigate those that look 'off'.

#### Number of calls

You may say: 'You would need 20,000 employees to handle the calls'

Well not if you had a well written, simple online form to submit all of your details.  Pay out BY DEFAULT.  So, assume TRUE until proven FALSE.  Then if the case is PROVEN FRAUDULENT sue to recoup the money.

Patterns will emerge that will identify frauds. (See point 2/3 above).

## How to ensure it works for all

#### Transparency

Everything the companies does should be online, it's bank statements, it's payout percentages, salaries paid, dividends etc.  They should be online, not hidden, front and centre.  These details should be easily accessible, online.  They should also be pointed highlighted in a way that would encourage lawsuits if found inaccurate.  Though we know how lawsuits are weaponised (SLAPP etc) they key would to predict the style and ensure accurate data so it can be thrown out in ten minutes.

#### Lack of greed

By not being greedy, and proving it with transparency it gives you smaller margins.  It will also allow to collect cash for unexpected disasters.

#### Lack of complexity

- Don't have a complicated company structure, one company, one set of accounts (transparency)
- Don't solve more problems, stick with just this one.
- Don't EVER go on the stock market.  The goals change.

## What could this achieve

#### Reduce inequality

Student debt and medical debt are handcuffs on the American population.  If this system pays for most care, you have removed one hand.  Even if it's expensive relative to European healthcare it is still cheaper than a bill you expected to have paid.

#### Helps establish who is telling the truth

In a world void of truth if you create something that everyone in the country can see is clearly working for all (after maybe 10 years), it makes it a lot easier to see who doesn't care.

#### Helps the environment

Once enough people have signed up you will be able to see patterns.  More importantly, patterns of abuse, of toxic dumping, of forever chemicals in the water, of excessive pollution production simply by what people are claiming for.

So
1. You could stop a community being destroyed before the documentary about it is created after the entire town is dead
2. You can scare companies with real penalties if you protected the people signed to the HCSM.  Assets = Lawyers.

#### Lobbying

If cash is kept behind you can use the cash to lobby for:

1. The environment against indicators in the customer claim base
2. Cheaper more reliable health care
